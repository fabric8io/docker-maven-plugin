[[docker:save]]
== *docker:save*

The `{plugin}:save` target saves an image defined in the build configuration to a local file, analogous to `docker save`.
If the option `saveFile` is not set, the file name is calculated automatically:

* If `saveAlias` is used then the file is stored as `target/<alias>-<project version>.tar.gz`
* Otherwise the archive is stored as `target/<image name without registry and user part>-<image tag>.tar.gz`

Please note that the exported image contains all image layers and can be quite large (also, it takes a bit to export the image).

| Element | Description | Property

| *saveName*
| The name of the image configuration to save. Must not be used together with `alias`.
| `docker.save.name`

| *saveAlias*
| The alias of the image configuration to save. Must not be used together with `name`.
| `docker.save.alias`

| *saveFile*
| The filename to save.
| `docker.save.file` or `docker.file` or `file`

| *saveAttach*
| Whether to attach the saved archive to the project (`false` by default).
| `docker.save.attach`

| *saveClassifier*
| Sets the artifact classifier when attaching the saved archive to the project. If `saveAlias` is set, defaults to `archive-<saveAlias>`, otherwise defaults to `archive`. Note that using overriding the default to use `docker` or `docker-<saveAlias>` may lead to a conflict if a source archive is also attached with <<{plugin}:source>>.
| `docker.save.classifier`

| *skipSave*
| A boolean flag whether to skip execution of the goal.
| `docker.skip.save`
