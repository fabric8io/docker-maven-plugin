= Authentication

When pulling (via the `autoPull` mode of `{plugin}:start`) or pushing image, it
might be necessary to authenticate against a Docker registry.

There are six different locations searched for credentials.  In order, these are:

* Providing system properties `docker.username` and `docker.password` from the outside.
* Providing system properties `registry.username` and `registry.password` from the outside.
* Using a `<authConfig>` section in the plugin configuration with `<username>` and `<password>` elements.
* Using OpenShift configuration in `~/.config/kube`
* Using a `<server>` configuration in `~/.m2/settings.xml`
* Login into a registry with `docker login` (credentials in a credential helper or in `~/.docker/config.json`)

Using the username and password directly in the `pom.xml` is not
recommended since this is widely visible. This is easiest and
transparent way, though. Using an `<authConfig>` is straight forward:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <configuration>
    <image>consol/tomcat-7.0</image>
    ...
    <authConfig>
      <username>jolokia</username>
      <password>s!cr!t</password>
    </authConfig>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The system property provided credentials are a good compromise when
using CI servers like Jenkins. You simply provide the credentials from
the outside:

.Example
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
mvn -Ddocker.username=jolokia -Ddocker.password=s!cr!t {plugin}:push
----

The most _mavenish_ way is to add a server to the Maven settings file `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<servers>
  <server>
    <id>docker.io</id>
    <username>jolokia</username>
    <password>s!cr!t</password>
  </server>
  ....
</servers>
----

The server id must specify the registry to push to/pull from, which by
default is central index `docker.io` (or `index.docker.io` / `registry.hub.docker.com` as fallbacks).
Here you should add your docker.io account for your repositories. If you have multiple accounts
for the same registry, the second user can be specified as part of the ID. In the example above, if you
have a second account 'fabric8io' then use an `<id>docker.io/fabric8io</id>` for this second entry. I.e. add the
username with a slash to the id name. The default without username is only taken if no server entry with
a username appended id is chosen.

The most _secure_ way is to rely on docker's credential store or credential helper and read confidential information
from an external credentials store, such as the native keychain of the operating system. Follow the instruction on
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store[the docker login documentation].

As a final fallback, this plugin consults `$DOCKER_CONFIG/config.json` if `DOCKER_CONFIG` is set, or `~/.docker/config.json` if not, and reads credentials stored directly within this
file. This unsafe behavior happened when connecting to a registry with the command `docker login` from the command line
with older versions of docker (pre 1.13.0) or when docker is not configured to use a
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store[credential store].

== Pull vs. Push Authentication

The credentials lookup described above is valid for both push and
pull operations. In order to narrow things down, credentials can be
provided for pull or push operations alone:

In an `<authConfig>` section a sub-section `<pull>` and/or `<push>`
can be added. In the example below the credentials provider are only
used for image push operations:

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <configuration>
    <image>consol/tomcat-7.0</image>
    ...
    <authConfig>
      <push>
         <username>jolokia</username>
         <password>s!cr!t</password>
      </push>
    </authConfig>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

When the credentials are given on the command line as system
properties, then the properties `docker.pull.username` /
`docker.pull.password` and `docker.push.username` /
`docker.push.password` are used for pull and push operations,
respectively (when given). Either way, the standard lookup algorithm
as described in the previous section is used as fallback.

== OpenShift Authentication

When working with the default registry in OpenShift, the credentials
to authenticate are the OpenShift username and access token. So, a
typical interaction with the OpenShift registry from the outside is:

----
oc login
...
mvn -Ddocker.registry=docker-registry.domain.com:80/default/myimage \
    -Ddocker.username=$(oc whoami) \
    -Ddocker.password=$(oc whoami -t)
----

(note, that the image's username part ("default" here") must
correspond to an OpenShift project with the same name to which you
currently connected account has access).

This can be simplified by using the system property
`docker.useOpenShiftAuth` in which case the plugin does the
lookup. The equivalent to the example above is

----
oc login
...
mvn -Ddocker.registry=docker-registry.domain.com:80/default/myimage \
    -Ddocker.useOpenShiftAuth
----

Alternatively the configuration option `<useOpenShiftAuth>` can be
added to the `<authConfig>` section.

For dedicated _pull_ and _push_ configuration the system properties
`docker.pull.useOpenShiftAuth` and `docker.push.useOpenShiftAuth` are
available as well as the configuration option `<useOpenShiftAuth>` in
an `<pull>` or `<push>` section within the `<authConfig>`
configuration.

If `useOpenShiftAuth` is enabled then the OpenShift Konfiguration will be looked up in `$KUBECONFIG` or, if this environment variable is not set, in `~/.kube/config`.

[[password-encryption]]
== Password encryption

Regardless which mode you choose you can encrypt password as described
in the
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Maven documentation]. Assuming
that you have setup a _master password_ in
`~/.m2/security-settings.xml` you can create easily encrypt
passwords:

.Example
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn --encrypt-password
Password:
{QJ6wvuEfacMHklqsmrtrn1/ClOLqLm8hB7yUL23KOKo=}
----

This password then can be used in `authConfig`, `docker.password`
and/or the `<server>` setting configuration. However, putting an
encrypted password into `authConfig` in the `pom.xml` doesn't make
much sense, since this password is encrypted with an individual master
password.

[[extended-authentication]]
== Extended Authentication

Some docker registries require additional steps to authenticate.
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_GetStarted.html[Amazon ECR] requires using an IAM access key to obtain temporary docker login credentials.
The `docker:push` and `docker:pull` goals automatically execute this exchange for any registry of the form _<awsAccountId>_ *.dkr.ecr.* _<awsRegion>_ *.amazonaws.com*, unless the `skipExtendedAuth` configuration (`docker.skip.extendedAuth` property) is set true.

Note that for an ECR repository with URI `123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example/image` the d-m-p's `docker.registry` should be set to `123456789012.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com` and `example/image` is the `<name>` of the image.

You can use any IAM access key with the necessary permissions in any of the locations mentioned above except `~/.docker/config.json`.
Use the IAM *Access key ID* as the username and the *Secret access key* as the password.
In case you're using temporary security credentials provided by the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), you have to provide the *security token* as well.
To do so, either specify the `docker.auth` system property or provide an `<auth>` element alongside username & password in the `authConfig`.

d-m-p will attempt to read AWS credentials from some well-known spots in case there is no explicit configuration:

* it will pick up ENV variables link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html[as documented for the AWS CLI]

* it will pick up temporary credentials of link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html[the IAM role of an EC2 instance]

* it will pick up temporary credentials of link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html[the IAM role of a fargate task (OR ECS with EC2 with ECS_AWSVPC_BLOCK_IMDS as "true")]

If any of these authentication information is accessible, it will be used.

[NOTE]
====
For a more complete, robust and reliable authentication experience, you can add the AWS SDK for Java as a dependency.

[source,xml]
----
<plugins>
    <plugin>
        <groupId>io.fabric8</groupId>
        <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
                <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-core</artifactId>
                <version>1.11.707</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </plugin>
</plugins>
----

This extra dependency allows the usage of all link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html[options] that the AWS default credential provider chain provides.

If the AWS SDK is found in the classpath, it takes precedence over the custom AWS credentials lookup mechanisms listed above.
