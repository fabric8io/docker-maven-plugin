This plugin supports the following goals which are explained in detail
in the next sections.

|**<<{plugin}:stop>>**

|===

Note that all goals are orthogonal to each other. For example in order
to start a container for your application you typically have to build
its image before. `{plugin}:start` does *not* imply building the image
so you should use it then in combination with `{plugin}:build`.

All goals fork the lifecycle phase to call the lifecycle up to the *initialize* phase. This means you can bind other plugins to the phases *initialize* or *validate* for customization. By default no action is bound to these phases. See https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html[Introduction to the Build Lifecycle] for more details about phases and lifecycles.

****
Note however that when you bind the goals about to lifecycle phases this will result in the *initialize* and *validate* phase called twice. Your bound plugins should be able to handle this.
