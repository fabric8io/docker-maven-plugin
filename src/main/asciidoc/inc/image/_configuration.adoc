.Image Configuration
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| Each `<image>` configuration has a mandatory, unique docker
repository _name_. This can include registry and tag parts, but also placeholder parameters. See below for a detailed explanation.

| *alias*
| Shortcut name for an image which can be used for
identifying the image within this configuration. This is used when
linking images together or for specifying it with the global *image* configuration element.

| <<registry, *registry*>>
| Registry to use for this image. If the `name` already contains a registry this takes precedence. See <<registry,Registry handling>> for more details.

| <<config-image-build, *build*>>
| Element which contains all the configuration aspects when doing a <<{plugin}:build>>. This element can be omitted if the image is only pulled from a registry e.g. as support for integration tests like database images.

ifeval::["{plugin}" == "docker"]
| <<config-image-run, *run*>>
| Element which describe how containers should be
created and run when <<{plugin}:start>> is called. If this image is only used a _data container_ (i.e. is supposed only to be mounted as a volume) for exporting artifacts via volumes this section can be missing.

| <<external-configuration, *external*>>
| Specification of external configuration as an alternative to this XML based configuration with `<run>` and `<build>`. It contains a `<type>` element specifying the handler for getting the configuration. See <<external-configuration,External configuration>> for details.
endif::[]

| *removeNamePattern*
| When this image is to be removed by <<{plugin}:remove>>, use this <<name-patterns, pattern list>> to find images to
remove rather than just using the name.

| *stopNamePattern*
| When containers associated with this image will be stopped by <<{plugin}:stop>>, use this <<name-patterns, pattern list>>
to find containers to remove rather than just using the associated container name.
