    <volumes>
       <volume>
         <name>myVolumeName</name>
         <driver>Local</Driver>
         <driverOpts>
           <someKey>someValue</someKey>
         </driverOpts>
         <labels>
           <someKey>someValue</someKey>
         </labels>
       </volume>
    </volumes>
    ...
  </configuration>
</plugin>
