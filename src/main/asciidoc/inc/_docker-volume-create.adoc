[[docker:volume-create]]
== *docker:volume-create*

This goals creates one or more standalone https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/[Docker volume], which can be referenced in a <<docker:start>> configuration for linking to a volume during runtime.
Each volume has therefore a unique and referenceable name. Beside the volume driver and driver options can be specified.

The following options are available when creating volumes:

.Volume configuration
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| Name of the volume

| *driver*
| Volume driver to use. By default the driver `local` is used which is created on the local file system. Please refer to your Docker installation which additional drivers are available.

| *opts*
| Driver specific options passed in as custom `<key>value</key>` where its maps to `key=value` pairs for driver options as they can be provided from the Docker CLI, too. Each volume driver supports different options. The options supported by the `local` driver are the well known http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html[Linux mount options].

|*labels*
| Labels given as `<key>value</key>` similar to image labels described in <<misc-env, Environment and Labels>>. These labels are used to tag the volumes themselves.
