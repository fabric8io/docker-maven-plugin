= External Configuration

For special configuration needs, there is the possibility to get the
runtime and build configuration from places outside the plugin's
configuration. This is done with the help of `<external>`
configuration sections which at least has a `<type>` subelement. This
`<type>` element selects a specific so called "handler" which is
responsible for creating the full image configuration. A handler can
decide to use the `<run>` and `<build>` configuration which could
be provided in addition to this `<external>` section or it can decide
to completely ignore any extra configuration option.

A handler can also decide to expand this single image configuration to
a list of image configurations. The image configurations resulting
from such a external configuration are added to the _regular_
`<image>` configurations without an `<external>` section.

The available handlers are described in the following.
