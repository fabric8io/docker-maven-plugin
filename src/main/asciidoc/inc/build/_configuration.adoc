All build relevant configuration is contained in the `<build>` section
of an image configuration. The following configuration options are supported:

[[config-image-build]]
.Build configuration (<<config-image, <image> >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| <<config-image-build-assembly, *assembly*>>
| specifies the assembly configuration as described in <<build-assembly,Build Assembly>>

| <<build-buildargs, *args*>>
| Map specifying the value of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables-build-arg[Docker build args]
which should be used when building the image with an external Dockerfile which uses build arguments. The key-value syntax is the same as when defining Maven properties (or `labels` or `env`).
This argument is ignored when no external Dockerfile is used. Build args can also be specified as properties as
described in <<build-buildargs,Build Args>>

| *buildOptions*
| Map specifying the build options to provide to the docker daemon when building the image. These options map to the ones listed as query parameters in the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#build-image-from-a-dockerfile[Docker Remote API] and are restricted to simple options
(e.g.: memory, shmsize). If you use the respective configuration options for build options natively supported by the build configuration (i.e. `noCache`, `cleanup=remove` for buildoption `forcerm=1` and `args` for build args) then these will override any corresponding options given here. The key-value syntax is the same as when defining environment variables or labels as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.

| *cleanup*
| Cleanup dangling (untagged) images after each build (including any containers created from them). Default is `try` which tries to remove the old image, but doesn't fail the build if this is not possible because e.g. the image is still used by a running container. Use `remove` if you want to fail the build and `none` if no cleanup is requested.

| [[context-dir]]*contextDir*
| Path to a directory used for the build's context. You can specify the `Dockerfile` to use with *dockerFile*, which by default is the Dockerfile found in the `contextDir`. The Dockerfile can be also located outside of the `contextDir`, if provided with an absolute file path. See <<external-dockerfile, External Dockerfile>> for details.

| <<misc-startup, *cmd*>>
| A command to execute by default (i.e. if no command is provided when a container for this image is started). See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.

| *compression*
| The compression mode how the build archive is transmitted to the docker daemon (`{plugin}:build`) and how docker build archives are attached to this build as sources (`{plugin}:source`). The value can be `none` (default), `gzip` or `bzip2`.

| *dockerFile*
| Path to a `Dockerfile` which also triggers _Dockerfile mode_. See <<external-dockerfile, External Dockerfile>> for details.

| *dockerFileDir* (_deprecated_ in favor of *<<context-dir, contextDir>>*)
| Path to a directory holding a `Dockerfile` and switch on _Dockerfile mode_. See <<external-dockerfile, External Dockerfile>> for details. _This option is deprecated in favor of _contextDir_ and will be removed for the next major release_.

| *dockerArchive*
| Path to a saved image archive which is then imported. See <<external-dockerfile, Docker archive>> for details.

| <<misc-startup, *entryPoint*>>
| An entrypoint allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.

| <<misc-env, *env*>>
| The environments as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.

| *filter*
| Enable and set the delimiters for property replacements. By default properties in the format `${..}` are replaced with Maven properties. You can switch off property replacement by setting this property to `false`. When using a single char like `@` then this is used as a delimiter (e.g `@...@`). See <<build-filtering, Filtering>> for more details.

| [[build-config-from]]*from*
| The base image which should be used for this image. If not given this default to `busybox:latest` and is suitable for a pure data image.
ifeval::["{plugin}" == "fabric8"]
In case of an <<build-openshift,S2I Binary build>> this parameter specifies the S2I Builder Image to use, which by default is `fabric8/s2i-java:latest`. See also <<build-config-from-ext,from-ext>> how to add additional properties for the base image.

endif::[]

| [[build-config-from-ext]]**fromExt**
a| Extended definition for a base image. This field holds a map of defined in `<key>value</key>` format. The known keys are:

* `<name>` : Name of the base image
ifeval::["{plugin}" == "fabric8"]
* `<kind>` : Kind of the reference to the builder image when in S2I build mode. By default its `ImageStreamTag` but can be also `ImageStream`. An alternative would be `DockerImage`
* `<namespace>` : Namespace where this builder image lives.

endif::[]

A provided `<from>` takes precedence over the name given here. This tag is useful for extensions of this plugin like the https://maven.fabric8.io[fabric8-maven-plugin] which can evaluate the additional information given here.

| <<build-healthcheck, *healthCheck*>>
| Definition of a health check as described in <<build-healthcheck, Healthcheck>>

| *imagePullPolicy*
| Specific pull policy for the base image. This overwrites any global pull policy. See the globale configuration option <<image-pull-policy, imagePullPolicy>> for the possible values and the default.

| [[build-config-load-name-pattern]]*loadNamePattern*
a| Scan the archive specified in `dockerArchive` and find the actual repository and tag in the archive that matches this <<name-patterns, name pattern>>. After loading the archive, link the <<config-image, image name>> configured in the POM to the repository and tag matched in the archive.

| <<misc-env, *labels*>>
| Labels  as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.

| *maintainer*
| The author (`MAINTAINER`) field for the generated image

| *noCache*
| Don't use Docker's build cache. This can be overwritten by setting a system property `docker.noCache` when running Maven.

| *cacheFrom*
| A list of `<image>` elements specifying image names to use as cache sources.

| *optimise*
| if set to true then it will compress all the `runCmds` into a single `RUN` directive so that only one image layer is created.

| *ports*
| The exposed ports which is a list of `<port>` elements, one for each port to expose. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored. The format can be either pure numerical ("8080") or with the protocol attached ("8080/tcp").

| *shell*
| Shell to be used for the *runCmds*. It contains *arg* elements which are defining the executable and its params.

| *runCmds*
| Commands to be run during the build process. It contains *run* elements which are passed to the shell. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored. The run commands are inserted right after the assembly and after *workdir* into the Dockerfile. This tag is not to be confused with the `<run>` section for this image which specifies the runtime behaviour when starting containers.

| *skip*
| if set to true disables building of the image. This config option is best used together with a maven property

| *skipTag*
| If set to `true` this plugin won't add any tags to images. Property: `docker.skip.tag`

| *tags*
| List of additional `tag` elements with which an image is to be tagged after the build. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored.

| *user*
| User to which the Dockerfile should switch to the end (corresponds to the `USER` Dockerfile directive).

| *volumes*
| List of `volume` elements to create a container volume. Whitespace is trimmed from each element and empty elements are ignored.

| *workdir*
| Directory to change to when starting the container.
|===

From this configuration this Plugin creates an in-memory Dockerfile,
copies over the assembled files and calls the Docker daemon via its
remote API.
