All build relevant configuration is contained in the `<build>` section
of an image configuration. In addition to `<dockerFileDir>` and
`<dockerFile>` the following configuration options are available:

[[config-image-build]]
.Build configuration (<<config-image, <image> >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| <<config-image-build-assembly, *assembly*>>
| specifies the assembly configuration as described in <<build-assembly,Build Assembly>>

| <<config-image-build-buildargs, *buildArgs*>>
| Map specifying the value of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables-build-arg[Docker build args]
which should be used when building the image with an external Dockerfile which uses build arguments. The key-value syntax is the same as when defining Maven properties (or `labels` or `env`).
This argument is ignored when no external Dockerfile is used. Build args can also be specified as properties as
described in <<build-buildargs,Build Args>>

| *buildOptions*
| Map specifying the build options to provide to the docker daemon when building the image. These options map to the ones listed as query parameters in the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.24/#build-image-from-a-dockerfile[Docker Remote API] and are restricted to simple options
(e.g.: memory, shmsize). Use the respective configuration options for build options natively supported by the build configuration (like `nocache`).
The key-value syntax is the same as when defining Maven properties (or `labels` or `env`).

| *cleanup*
| Cleanup dangling (untagged) images after each build (including any containers created from them). Default is `try` which tries to remove the old image, but doesn't fail the build if this is not possible because e.g. the image is still used by a running container. Use `remove` if you want to fail the build and `none` if no cleanup is requested.

| <<misc-startup, *cmd*>>
| A command to execute by default (i.e. if no command is provided when a container for this image is started). See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.

| *compression*
| The compression mode how the build archive is transmitted to the docker daemon (`{plugin}:build`) and how docker build archives are attached to this build as sources (`{plugin}:source`). The value can be `none` (default), `gzip` or `bzip2`.

| <<misc-startup, *entryPoint*>>
| An entrypoint allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. See <<misc-startup,Startup Arguments>> for details.

| <<misc-env, *env*>>
| The environments as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.

| [[build-config-from]]*from*
| The base image which should be used for this image. If not given this default to `busybox:latest` and is suitable for a pure data image.
ifeval::["{plugin}" == "fabric8"]
In case of an <<build-openshift,S2I Binary build>> this parameter specifies the S2I Builder Image to use, which by default is `fabric8/s2i-java:latest`. See also <<build-config-from-ext,from-ext>> how to add additional properties for the base image.

endif::[]

| [[build-config-from-ext]]**fromExt**
a| Extended definition for a base image. This field holds a map of defined in `<key>value</key>` format. The known keys are:

* `<name>` : Name of the base image
ifeval::["{plugin}" == "fabric8"]
* `<kind>` : Kind of the reference to the builder image when in S2I build mode. By default its `ImageStreamTag` but can be also `ImageStream`. An alternative would be `DockerImage`
* `<namespace>` : Namespace where this builder image lives.

endif::[]

A provided `<from>` takes precedence over the name given here. This tag is useful for extensions of this plugin like the https://maven.fabric8.io[fabric8-maven-plugin] which can evaluate the additional information given here.

| <<build-healthcheck, *healthCheck*>>
a| Definition of a health check as described in <<build-healthcheck, Healthcheck>>

| <<misc-env, *labels*>>
| Labels  as described in <<misc-env,Setting Environment Variables and Labels>>.

| *maintainer*
| The author (`MAINTAINER`) field for the generated image

| *nocache*
| Don't use Docker's build cache. This can be overwritten by setting a system property `docker.nocache` when running Maven.

| *optimise*
| if set to true then it will compress all the `runCmds` into a single `RUN` directive so that only one image layer is created.

| *ports*
| The exposed ports which is a list of `<port>` elements, one for each port to expose. The format can be either pure numerical ("8080") or with the protocol attached ("8080/tcp"),

| *runCmds*
| Commands to be run during the build process. It contains *run* elements which are passed to the shell. The run commands are inserted right after the assembly and after *workdir* in to the Dockerfile. This tag is not to be confused with the `<run>` section for this image which specifies the runtime behaviour when starting containers.

| *skip*
| if set to true disables building of the image. This config option is best used together with a maven property

| *tags*
| List of additional `tag` elements with which an image is to be tagged after the build.

| *user*
| User to which the Dockerfile should switch to the end (corresponds to the `USER` Dockerfile directive).

| *volumes*
| List of `volume` elements to create a container volume.

| *workdir*
| Directory to change to when starting the container.
|===

From this configuration this Plugin creates an in-memory Dockerfile,
copies over the assembled files and calls the Docker daemon via its
remote API.
