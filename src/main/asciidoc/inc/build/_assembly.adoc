The `<assembly>` element within `<build>` is has an XML struture and defines how build artifacts and other files can enter the Docker image.

[[config-image-build-assembly]]
.Assembly Configuration (<<config-image, <image> >> : <<config-image-build, <build> >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *name*
| Assembly name, which is `maven` by default. This name is used for the archives and directories created during the build. This directory holds the files specified by the assembly. If an <<external-dockerfile,external Dockerfile>> is used than this name is also the relative directory which contains the assembly files.

| *targetDir*
| Directory under which the files and artifacts contained in the assembly will be copied within the container. The default value for this is `/<assembly name>`, so `/maven` if *name* is not set to a different value. This option has no meaning when an <<external-dockerfile,external Dockerfile>> is used.

| <<build-assembly-descriptor, *inline*>>
| Inlined assembly descriptor as described in <<build-assembly-descriptor,Assembly Descriptor>> below.

| <<build-assembly-descriptor, *descriptor*>>
| Path to an assembly descriptor file, whose format is described  <<build-assembly-descriptor,Assembly Descriptor>> below.

| <<build-assembly-descriptor-refs, *descriptorRef*>>
| Alias to a predefined assembly descriptor. The available aliases are also described in <<build-assembly-descriptor,Assembly Descriptor>> below.

| *dockerFileDir*
| Directory containing an external Dockerfile. _This option is deprecated, please use <dockerFileDir> directly in the <build> section_.

| *exportTargetDir*
| Specification whether the `targetDir` should be exported as a volume.  This value is `true` by default except in the case the `targetDir` is set to the container root (`/`). It is also `false` by default when a base image is used with `from` since exporting makes no sense in this case and will waste disk space unnecessarily.

| *ignorePermissions*
| Specification if existing file permissions should be ignored
when creating the assembly archive with a mode `dir`. This value is `false` by default. _This property is deprecated, use a `permissions` of `ignore` instead._

| *mode*
a| Mode how the how the assembled files should be collected:

* `dir` : Files are simply copied (default),
* `tar` : Transfer via tar archive
* `tgz` : Transfer via compressed tar archive
* `zip` : Transfer via ZIP archive

The archive formats have the advantage that file permission can be preserved better (since the copying is independent from the underlying files systems), but might triggers internal bugs from the Maven assembler (as it has been reported in https://github.com/fabric8io/docker-maven-plugin/issues/171[#171])

| *permissions*
a| Permission of the files to add:

* `ignore` to use the permission as found on files regardless on any
assembly configuration
* `keep` to respect the assembly provided permissions, `exec` for setting the executable bit on all files (required for Windows when using an assembly mode `dir`)
* `auto` to let the plugin select `exec` on Windows and `keep` on others.

`keep` is the default value.

| *tarLongFileMode*
| Sets the TarArchiver behaviour on file paths with more than 100 characters length. Valid values are: "warn"(default), "fail", "truncate", "gnu", "posix", "posix_warn" or "omit"

| [[config-image-build-assembly-user]] *user*
| User and/or group under which the files should be added. The user must already exist in the base image.

It has the general format `user[:group[:run-user]]`. The user and group can be given either as numeric user- and group-id or as names. The group id is optional.

If a third part is given, then the build changes to user `root` before changing the ownerships, changes the ownerships and then change to user `run-user` which is then used for the final command to execute. This feature might be needed, if the base image already changed the user (e.g. to 'jboss') so that a `chown` from root to this user would fail.

For example, the image `jboss/wildfly` use a "jboss" user under which all commands are executed. Adding files in Docker always happens under the UID root. These files can only be changed to "jboss" is the `chown` command is executed as root. For the following commands to be run again as "jboss" (like the final `standalone.sh`), the plugin switches back to user `jboss` (this is this "run-user") after changing the file ownership. For this example a specification of
`jboss:jboss:jboss` would be required.

In the event you do not need to include any artifacts with the image, you may safely omit this element from the configuration.

[[build-assembly-descriptor]]
==== Assembly Descriptor

With using the `inline`, `descriptor` or `descriptorRef` option
it is possible to bring local files, artifacts and dependencies into
the running Docker container. A `descriptor` points to a file
describing the data to put into an image to build. It has the same
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly.html[format] as for creating assemblies with the
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin[maven-assembly-plugin] with following exceptions:

* `<formats>` are ignored, the assembly will allways use a directory
when preparing the data container (i.e. the format is fixed to
`dir`)
* The `<id>` is ignored since only a single assembly descriptor is
used (no need to distinguish multiple descriptors)

Also you can inline the assembly description with a `inline` description
directly into the pom file. Adding the proper namespace even allows for
IDE autocompletion. As an example, refer to the profile `inline` in
the `data-jolokia-demo` 's pom.xml.

Alternatively `descriptorRef` can be used with the name of a
predefined assembly descriptor. The following symbolic names can be
used for `descriptorRef`:

[[build-assembly-descriptor-refs]]
.Predefined Assembly Descriptors
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Assembly Reference | Description

| *artifact-with-dependencies*
| Attaches project's artifact and all its dependencies. Also, when a `classpath` file exists in the target directory, this will be added to.

| *artifact*
| Attaches only the project's artifact but no dependencies.

| *project*
| Attaches the whole Maven project but with out the `target/` directory.

| *rootWar*
| Copies the artifact as `ROOT.war` to the exposed directory. I.e. Tomcat will then deploy the war under the root context.
|===

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<images>
  <image>
    <build>
      <assembly>
         <descriptorRef>artifact-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
         .....
----

will add the created artifact with the name `${project.build.finalName}.${artifact.extension}` and all jar dependencies in the the `targetDir` (which is `/maven` by default).

All declared files end up in the configured `targetDir` (or `/maven` by default) in the created image.

.Maven peculiarities when including the artifact
If the assembly references the artifact to build with this pom, it is required that the `package` phase is included in the run. Otherwise the artifact file, can't be found by `docker:build`. This is an old https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MASSEMBLY-94[outstanding issue] of the assembly plugin which probably can't be fixed because of the way how Maven works. We tried hard to workaround this issue and in 90% of all cases, you won't experience any problem. However, when the following warning happens which might lead to the given error:

[source]
----
[WARNING] Cannot include project artifact: io.fabric8:helloworld:jar:0.20.0; it doesn't have an associated file or directory.
[WARNING] The following patterns were never triggered in this artifact inclusion filter:
o  'io.fabric8:helloworld'

[ERROR] DOCKER> Failed to create assembly for docker image  (with mode 'dir'): Error creating assembly archive docker: You must set at least one file.
----

then you have two options to fix this:

* Call `mvn package {plugin}:build` to explicitly run "package" and "docker:build" in a chain.
* Bind `build` to an to an execution phase in the plugin's definition. By default `{plugin}:build` will bind to the `install` phase is set in an execution. Then you can use a plain `mvn install` for building the artifact and creating the image.

[source,xml]
----
<executions>
  <execution>
    <id>docker-build</id>
    <goals>
       <goal>build</goal>
    </goals>
  </execution>
</executions>
----

.Example

In the following example a dependency from the pom.xml is included and
mapped to the name `jolokia.war`. With this configuration you will end
up with an image, based on `busybox` which has a directory `/maven`
containing a single file `jolokia.war`. This volume is also exported
automatically.

[source,xml]
----
<assembly>
  <inline>
    <dependencySets>
      <dependencySet>
        <includes>
          <include>org.jolokia:jolokia-war</include>
        </includes>
        <outputDirectory>.</outputDirectory>
        <outputFileNameMapping>jolokia.war</outputFileNameMapping>
      </dependencySet>
    </dependencySets>
  </inline>
</assembly>
----

Another container can now connect to the volume an 'mount' the
`/maven` directory. A container  from `consol/tomcat-7.0` will look
into `/maven` and copy over everything to `/opt/tomcat/webapps` before
starting Tomcat.

If you are using the `artifact` or `artifact-with-dependencies` descriptor, it is
possible to change the name of the final build artifact with the following:

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <finalName>your-desired-final-name</finalName>
  ...
</build>
----

Please note, based upon the following documentation listed http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#BaseBuild_Element[here], there is no guarantee the plugin creating your artifact will honor it in which case you will need to use a custom descriptor like above to achieve the desired naming.

Currently the `jar` and `war` plugins properly honor the usage of `finalName`.
