[[build-overview]]
There are two different modes how Images can be built:

.Inline plugin configuration
With an inline plugin configuration all information required to build the image is contained in the plugin configuration. By default its the standard XML based configuration for the plugin but can be switched to a property based configuration syntax as described in the section <<external-configuration,External configuration>>. The XML configuration syntax is recommended because of its more structured and typed nature.

When using this mode, the Dockerfile is created on the fly with all instructions extracted from the configuration given.

[[external-dockerfile]]
.External Dockerfile or docker archive
Alternatively an external Dockerfile template or Docker archive can be used. This mode is switch on by using one of these three configuration options within

* *dockerFileDir* specifies a directory containing a Dockerfile that will be used to create the image. The name of the Dockerfile is `Dockerfile` by default but can be also set with the option `dockerFile` (see below).
* *dockerFile* specifies a specific Dockerfile path. The Docker build context directory is set to `dockerFileDir` if given. If not the directory by default is the directory in which the Dockerfile is stored.
* *dockerFileTemplate* specifies a Dockerfile which contains variables to be interpolated.  The variable names should be delimited with a double percent "%%" before and after the variable name, for example, "%%myprop%%".  These variables will be replaced by the matching property name in the Maven build.
* *dockerArchive* specifies a previously saved image archive to load directly. Such a tar archive can be created with `docker save`. If a `dockerArchive` is provided, no `dockerFile` or `dockerFileDir` must be given.

All paths can be either absolute or relative paths (except when both `dockerFileDir` and `dockerFile` are provided in which case `dockerFile` must not be absolute). A relative path is looked up in `${project.basedir}/src/main/docker` by default. You can make it easily an absolute path by using `${project.basedir} in your configuration.

Any additional files located in the `dockerFileDir` directory will also be added to the build context as well as any files specified by an assembly. However, you still need to insert `ADD` or `COPY` directives yourself into the Dockerfile.

If this directory contains a `.maven-dockerignore` (or alternatively, a `.maven-dockerexclude` file), then it is used for excluding files for the build. Each line in this file is treated as an http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html[FileSet exclude pattern] as used by the http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin[maven-assembly-plugin]. It is similar to `.dockerignore` when using Docker but has a slightly different syntax (hence the different name).

If this directory contains a `.maven-dockerinclude` file, then it is used for including only those files for the build. Each line in this file is also treated as an http://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html[FileSet exclude pattern] as used by the http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin[maven-assembly-plugin].

Except for the <<build-assembly,assembly configuration>> all other configuration options are ignored for now.

****
For the future it is planned to introduce special keywords like `DMP_ADD_ASSEMBLY` which can be used in the Dockerfile template to placing the configuration resulting from the additional configuration.
****

The following example uses a Dockerfile in the directory
`src/main/docker/demo`:

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
 <configuration>
   <images>
     <image>
       <name>user/demo</name>
       <build>
         <dockerFileDir>demo</dockerFileDir>
       </build>
     </image>
   </images>
 </configuration>
 ...
</plugin>
----

Please note that `docker:build` fork the Maven lifecycle and calls all phases up to and including `package`. The reason for this is that for the assembly to be able to reference an artifact which is part of the build it needs to be included with this `package` phase. This is a general restriction of the Maven lifecycle which applies also to the `maven-assembly-plugin` itself.

When you want to bind the build to an `<execution>` in the plugin configuration to bind it to a phase, please use the goal `build-nofork` which does not fork the lifecycle and avoids calling goals twice.
