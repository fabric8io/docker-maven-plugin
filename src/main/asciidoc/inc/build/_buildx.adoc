| Element | Description

| *builderName*
| Name of builder to use with buildx.  If not supplied, a builder instance is dynamically created before each build and destroyed
after completion of build.

| *cache*
| Cache directory name, which is `cache` by default. This directory is used to cache image layers. If the directory name is relative,
the cache directory is resolved relative to `outputDirectory`.  If the cache name starts with `~/`, the cache directory is relative
to the user's home directory.

| *configFile*
| Configuration file for builder.  Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory.  If the cache name starts with
`~/`, the configuration file is relative to the user's home directory.

| *platforms*
| A list of `<platform>` elements specifying platform to build.  A platform has syntax of `OS/architecture` (e.g. linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64).
