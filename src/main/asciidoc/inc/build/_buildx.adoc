[[build-buildx]]

Buildx is enabled by seting the platform section of buildx configuration.  Only the native platform
built and loaded into the local repository by the build goal.  All specified platforms are built and
pushed by the push goal.

The `<buildx>` element within `<build>` defines how to build multi-architecture images.

| Element | Description

| *builderName*
| Name of builder to use with buildx.  If not supplied, the builder is named `maven`.  The builder is created as necessary.
The builder manages the build cache.

| *configFile*
| Configuration file for builder.  Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory.  If configFile starts with
`~/`, the configuration file is relative to the user's home directory.

| *dockerStateDir*
| State directory for docker builder.  This directory holds docker builder configurations and context state. Sharing a state
directory across builds will share the cache and will decrease pull times.
Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory. If dockerConfigDir starts with `~/`, the configuration directory
is relative to the user's home directory.

| *platforms*
| A list of `<platform>` elements specifying platform to build.  A platform has syntax of `OS/architecture` (e.g. linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64).
