| Element | Description

| *cache*
| Cache directory name, which is `cache` by default. This directory is used to cache image layers. If the directory name is relative,
the cache directory is resolved relative to `outputDirectory`.  If the cache name starts with `~/`, the cache directory is relative
to the user's home directory.

| *platforms*
| A list of `<platform>` elements specifying platform to build.  A platform has syntax of `OS/architecture` (e.g. linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64).
