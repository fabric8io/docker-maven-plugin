[[build-buildx]]

Buildx is enabled when there is a non-empty `<platform>` element inside the  `<buildx>` configuration.  Only the native platform
is built and saved in the local image cache by the `build` goal.  All specified platforms are built and pushed into the remote
repository by the `push` goal. This behavior is to prevent non-native images from tainting the local image cache.
Alternatively, `useBuildxOnlyOnPush` can be set. This will force the plugin to use buildx only on push making local builds faster.

The local image cache cannot hold multi-architecture images nor can it have two platform specific images of the same name. The
recommended `<buildx>` configuration is to specify all supported platforms, including the native platform, in the `<platforms>`
element.  This allows local integration testing of the build image from the local cache. During install or deploy phase, the
build machine will build and push all images to the registry.  Any downstream consumers, regardless of native architecture, will
be able to use the multi-architecture image.

The `<buildx>` element within `<build>` defines how to build multi-architecture images.

| Element | Description

| *builderName*
| Name of builder to use with buildx.  If not supplied, the builder is named `maven`.  The builder is created as necessary.
The builder manages the build cache.

| *configFile*
| Configuration file for builder.  Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory.  If configFile starts with
`~/`, the configuration file is relative to the user's home directory.

| *dockerStateDir*
| State directory for docker builder.  This directory holds docker builder configurations and context state. Sharing a state
directory across builds will share the cache and will decrease pull times.
Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory. If dockerConfigDir starts with `~/`, the configuration directory
is relative to the user's home directory.

| *platforms*
| A list of `<platform>` elements specifying platform to build.  A platform has syntax of `OS/architecture` (e.g. linux/amd64,
linux/arm64, darwin/amd64).  Each `<platform>` element may have a comma separated list of platforms.  Empty `<platform>`
elements are ignored.  If no platform architecture is specified, buildx is *not* used.  You can use

| *useBuildxOnlyOnPush*
| Forces the plugin to use buildx only on push. This may speed up local development as buildx `--load` used to load built images
to the local repository is relatively slow.

.Examples
The recommended configuration is setting a top level property with the list of platforms to build.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <docker.platforms></docker.platforms>
</properties>
----

Then in the image configuration, use the following;

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <images>
    <image>
      <name>${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}</name>
      <build>
        <buildx>
          <platforms>
            <platform>${docker.platforms}</platform>
          </platforms>
        </buildx>
        <!-- add other configuration ... -->
      </build>
    </image>
  </images>
</configuration>
----

You can now override the built platforms using a command line define:
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean deploy -Ddocker.platforms=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
