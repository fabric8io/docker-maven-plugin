[[build-buildx]]

Buildx is enabled when there is a non-empty `<platform>` element inside the  `<buildx>` configuration.

The local image cache cannot hold multi-architecture images nor can it have two platform specific images of the same name.
Thus the `build` goal will build and save a single-architecture image to the local image cache if possible:

* If the `<platform>` element contains a single platform, that image will be built.
* If the `<platform>` element contains more than one platform including the native platform, the native platform be used.
* If the `<platform>` element contains more than one platform not including the native platform, no image will be built.

These rules only apply to the image built and loaded into the local image cache with the `build` goal.  They do not apply to the
`push` goal which will always build and push either a single-architecture or multi-architecture image with whatever platforms
are specified in the `<platform>` element.

The recommended `<buildx>` configuration is to specify all supported platforms, including the native platform, in the
`<platform>` element.  This allows local integration testing of the build image from the local cache. During install or deploy
phase, the build machine will build and push a multi-architecture image containing all specified platforms to the registry.
Any downstream consumers, regardless of native architecture, will be able to use the multi-architecture image.

The `<buildx>` element within `<build>` defines how to build multi-architecture images.

| Element | Description

| *builderName*
| Name of builder to use with buildx.  If not supplied, the builder is named `maven`.  The builder is created as necessary.
The builder manages the build cache.

| *nodeName*
| Specify the name of the node to be created or modified.

| *configFile*
| Configuration file for builder.  Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory.  If configFile starts with
`~/`, the configuration file is relative to the user's home directory.

| *dockerStateDir*
| State directory for docker builder.  This directory holds docker builder configurations and context state. Sharing a state
directory across builds will share the cache and will decrease pull times.
Non-absolute files are relative to the maven project directory. If dockerConfigDir starts with `~/`, the configuration directory
is relative to the user's home directory.

| *platforms*
| A list of `<platform>` elements specifying platform to build.  A platform has syntax of `OS/architecture` (e.g. linux/amd64,
linux/arm64, darwin/amd64).  Each `<platform>` element may have a comma separated list of platforms.  Empty `<platform>`
elements are ignored.  If no platform architecture is specified, buildx is *not* used.  You can use

| *attestations*
| The configuration of attestation modes.  The `<provenance>` element may be set to `min`,
`max`, or `false`. The `<sbom>` element may be set to `true` or `false`. The `<provenance>`
element defaults to `min` and the `<sbom>` element defaults to `false`.
| *cacheFrom*
| A value to be passed through to the `--cache-from` option of `docker buildx build`. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#cache-from[docker buildx reference docs].
| *cacheTo*
| A value to be passed through to the `--cache-to` option of `docker buildx build`. See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/buildx_build/#cache-to[docker buildx reference docs].

.Examples
The recommended configuration is setting a top level property with the list of platforms to build.

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
  <docker.platforms></docker.platforms>
</properties>
----

Then in the image configuration, use the following;

[source,xml]
----
<configuration>
  <images>
    <image>
      <name>${project.groupId}.${project.artifactId}</name>
      <build>
        <buildx>
          <platforms>
            <platform>${docker.platforms}</platform>
          </platforms>
        </buildx>
        <!-- add other configuration ... -->
      </build>
    </image>
  </images>
</configuration>
----

You can now override the built platforms using a command line define:
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean deploy -Ddocker.platforms=linux/amd64,linux/arm64
