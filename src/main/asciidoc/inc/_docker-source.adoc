[[docker:source]]
== *docker:source*

The `{plugin}:source` target can be used to attach a docker build archive containing the Dockerfile and all added files to the Maven project with a certain classifier. It reuses the configuration from <<{plugin}:build>>.

By default, only the first image configuration is used for creating the source archive.
You can export all image configurations by setting the `sourceMode` configuration to `all`:

.Export all image configs
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <!-- source mode can be "first" or "all" -->
    <sourceMode>all</sourceMode>
    <!-- .... -->
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

For exporting all image configurations, `{plugin}:source` uses the image's link:image-configuration.md[alias] as part of the classifier, so it is mandatory that the alias is set for
this goal to work when all images should be exported this way.
The classifier is calculated as `docker-<alias>` so when the alias is set to `service`, then the classifier is `docker-service`.

If you only export the first image configuration (which is the default), then the classifier is just `docker` (without alias).

`{plugin}:source` can be attached to a Maven execution phase, which is `generate-sources` by default.

For example, this configuration will attach the docker build archive to the artifacts to store in the repository:

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <!-- ..... -->
  <executions>
     <execution>
       <id>sources</id>
       <goals>
         <goal>source</goal>
       </goals>
     </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

If not bound to an execution phase, `docker:source` requires that the artifact has been created so you call it best together with `package`
