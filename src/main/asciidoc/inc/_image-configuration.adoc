[[image-configuration]]
= Image configuration

The plugin's configuration is centered around _images_. These are
specified for each image within the `<images>` element of the
configuration with one `<image>` element per image to use.

The `<image>` element can contain the following sub elements:

include::image/_configuration.adoc[]

Either a `<build>` or `<run>` section must be present (except when you are using the <<simple-dockerfile-build,simple Dockerfile build>> mode). These are explained in details in the corresponding goal sections.

include::image/_example.adoc[]

When using Maven profiles, it can be useful to override settings
of a particular image. To facilitate this, the element `<imagesMap>`
can be used alongside the `<images>` element. Each entry in `<imagesMap>`
translates to an image configuration where the **alias** of the image
is set to the map entry's **key**. The examples above and below produce
identical image configurations.
