This plugin supports also configuration via a  https://docs.docker.com/compose/[docker-compose] file, especially for running containers specified in `docker-compose.yml`. Docker Compose handling is available also as an external configuration provider.

.Example
[source,xml]
----
<image>
  <alias>webapp</alias> <!--1-->
  <name>fabric8/compose-demo:latest</name>

  <external> <!--2-->
     <type>compose</type> <!--3-->
     <basedir>src/main/docker</basedir> <!--4-->
     <composeFile>docker-compose.yml</composeFile>
  </external>

  <build> <!--5-->
    <assembly>....</assembly>
  </build>
  <run>...</run>
  <watch>...</watch>
</image>
----
<1> The alias of the image is used as correlation key mapping to a service in the Docker Compose file
<2> An `<external>` configuration handler needs to be used for Docker Compose support
<3> The type for the external configuration provider must be set to **compose**
<4> Additional configuration for the handler where to find the compose file
<5> Extra `<build>`, `<run>` and `<watch>` configuration can be provided which are used as default configuration for the Docker compose service `webapp` (as specified with the alias)

The following options can be provided:

.Docker compose configuration
[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Default

| *basedir*
| Basedir where to find the compose file and which is also used as the current directory when examing the compose file.  Any relative volume bindings will be resolved relative to this directory.
| `${basedir}/src/main/docker`

| *composeFile*
| Name of the compose file to use
| `docker-compose.yml`

| *ignoreBuild*
| Ignore the compose file's `build:` section and use the plugin's build configuration exclusively.
| `false`
|===

The Docker Compose file can contain variables as described in the https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#/variable-substitution[Docker Compose documentation]. These are substituted with Maven project properties. Please note, when the `docker-compose.yml` with variables is to be used with the `docker-compose` CLI command, that these variables must also be valid environment variables (i.e. must not contain a `.`).

In addition to the `docker-compose.yml` you can add all known options for <<build-configuration,<build> >>, <<start-configuration,<run> >> and <<watch-configuration,<watch> >> configuration elements which are then used as defaults and are overwritten by the configuration defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. The merging between the XML configuration and the information found in `docker-compose.yml` is correlated via the `<alias>` name. E.g. if the XML image configuration is aliased with `webapp` then its is used as a default configuration for a Docker Compose _service_ name `webapp`. All other services defined in the compose file are left untouched.

=== Limitations

The following Docker Compose file keywords are not yet supported:

* `cgroup_parent`, `devices`, `env_file`, `expose`, `pid`, `security_opt`, `stop_signal`, `cpu_quota`, `ipc`, `mac_address`, `read_only` are not yet supported (but might be in a future version).
* `extend` for including other Docker Compose files is not yet implemented.
* Only **services** are currently evaluated, there is no supported yet for **volumes** and **networks**.
