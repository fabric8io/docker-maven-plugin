When developing and testing applications you will often have to rebuild Docker images and restart containers. Typing `{plugin}:build` and `{plugin}:start` all the time is cumbersome. With `{plugin}:watch` you can enable automatic rebuilding of images and restarting of containers in case of updates.

`{plugin}:watch` is the top-level goal which performs these tasks. There are two watch modes, which can be specified in multiple ways:

* `build` : Automatically rebuild one or more Docker images when one of the files selected by an assembly changes. This works for all files included directly in `assembly.xml` but also for arbitrary dependencies.

.Example
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
$ mvn package {plugin}:build {plugin}:watch -Ddocker.watchMode=build
----

This mode works only when there is a `<build>` section in an image configuration. Otherwise no automatically build will be triggered for an image with only a `<run>` section. Note that you need the `package` phase to be executed before otherwise any artifact created by this build can not be included into the assembly. As described in the section about `{plugin}:start` this is a Maven limitation.
* `run` : Automatically restart container when their associated images changes. This is useful if you pull a new version of an image externally or especially in combination with the `build` mode to restart containers when their image has been automatically rebuilt. This mode works reliably only when used together with `{plugin}:start`.

.Example
[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
----
$ mvn {plugin}:start {plugin}:watch -Ddocker.watchMode=run
----

* `both` : Enables both `build` and `run`. This is the default.
* `none` : Image is completely ignored for watching.
* `copy` : Copy changed files into the running container. This is the fast way to update a container, however the target container must support hot deploy, too so that it makes sense. Most application servers like Tomcat supports this.

The mode can also be `both` or `none` to select both or none of these variants, respectively. The default is `both`.

`{plugin}:watch` will run forever until it is interrupted with `CTRL-C` after which it will stop all containers. Depending on the configuration parameters `keepContainer` and `removeVolumes` the stopped containers with their volumes will be removed, too.

When an image is removed while watching it, error messages will be printed out periodically.  So don't do that ;-)

Dynamically assigned ports stay stable in that they won't change after a container has been stopped and a new container is created and started. The new container will try to allocate the same ports as the previous container.

If containers are linked together network or volume wise, and you update a container which other containers dependent on, the dependant containers are not restarted for now. E.g. when you have a "service" container accessing a "db" container and the "db" container is updated, then you "service" container will fail until it is restarted, too.

A future version of this plugin will take care of restarting
these containers, too (in the right order), but for now you would have
to do this manually.
