Custom networks do not provide a mechanism like `<links>` to express strong links between containers. They are normally not required because docker ensures that all containers within the same custom network can eventually resolve each other via DNS.

Your containers should preferably be able to deal with temporarily unresolvable dependencies but in some cases it is helpful to be able to rely the availability of other infrastructure containers.

The `<dependsOn>` configuration can be used to expresses custom network dependencies between your containers. `docker:start` will ensure that all dependencies a container depends on are completely started (fulfilling all `<wait>` conditions) before the depending container is started.

[source,xml]

<configuration>
  <!-- .... -->
  <run>
    <dependsOn>
      <container>postgres</container>
      <container>logstash</container>
    </dependsOn>
  </run>
</configuration>
