| Element | Description

| *capAdd*

| *capDrop*
| List of `drop` elements to specify kernel parameters to remove from the container.

| *cmd*
| Command which should be executed at the end of the container's startup. If not given, the image's default command is used. See <<misc-startup, Startup Arguments>> for details.

| *domainname*
| Domain name for the container

| *dns*
| List of `host` elements specifying dns servers for the container to use

| *dnsSearch*
| List of `host` elements specifying dns search domains

| *entrypoint*
| Entry point for the container. See <<misc-startup, Startup Arguments] for details.

| *env*
| Environment variables as subelements which are set during startup of the container. They are specified in the typical maven property format as described <<misc-env,Environment and Labels>>.

| *envPropertyFile*
| Path to a property file holding environment variables. If given, the variables specified in this property file overrides the environment variables specified in the configuration.

| *extraHosts*
| List of `host` elements in the form `host:ip` to add to the container's `/etc/hosts` file. Additionally, you may specify a `host` element in the form `host:host` to have the right side host ip address resolved at container startup.

| *hostname*
| Hostname of the container

| *labels*
| Labels which should be attached to the  container. They are specified in the typical maven property format as described in <<misc-env,Environment and Labels>>.

| *links*
| Network links for connecting containers together as described in  <<start-links, Network Links>>.

| *log*
| Log configuration for whether and how log messages from the running containers should be printed. This also can configure the https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview[log driver] to use. See <<start-logging,Logging>> for a detailed description.

| *memory*
| Memory limit in bytes

| *memorySwap*
| Total memory usage (memory + swap); use -1 to disable swap.

| *namingStrategy*
a| Naming strategy for how the container name is created:

* *none* : uses randomly assigned names from docker (default)
* *alias* : uses the `alias` specified in the `image` configuration. An error is thrown, if a container already exists with this name.

| *net*
a| Network mode for the container:

* *bridge* : Bridged mode with the default Docker bridge (default)
* *host* : Share the Docker host network interfaces
* *container:<alias or name>* : Connect to the network of the specified container
* *<custom network>* : Use the specified custom network which must be created before with `docker network create`. Available for Docker 1.9 and newer. For more about the networking options please refer to the https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/work-with-networks[Docker documentation].

| *portPropertyFile*
| File path into which the mapped port properties are written. The format of this file and its purpose are also described in <<start-port-mapping,Port mapping>>

| *ports*
| <<start-port-mapping,Port mappings>> for exposing container ports to host ports.

| *privileged*
| If `true` give container full access to host

| *restartPolicy*
| <<start-restart,Restart Policy>>

| *securityOpt*
| List of `opt` elements to specify kernel security options to add to the container.

| *shmSize*
| Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes.

| *skip*

| *user*
| User used inside the container

| *volumes*
| Volume configuration for binding to host directories and from other containers. See <<start-volumes,Volumes>> for details.

| *wait*
| Condition which must be fulfilled for the startup to complete. See <<start-wait,Wait>> for all possible ways to wait for a startup condition.

| *workingDir*
| Working directory for commands to run in
