In addition to the <<global-configuration>>, this goal supports the following global configuration options.

.Start options
[cols="1,5,1"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property

| <<container-name, *containerNamePattern*>>
| Default pattern for naming all containers when they are created. See <<container-name, Container Names>> for details.
| `docker.containerNamePattern`

| *showLogs*
| In order to switch on globally the logs *showLogs* can be used as global configuration (i.e. outside of `<images>`). If set it will print out all standard
 output and standard error messages for all containers started. As value the images for which logs should be shown can be given as a comma separated list.
 This is probably most useful when used from the command line as system property `docker.showLogs`.
| `docker.showLogs`

| *startParallel*
| Starts docker images in parallel while dependencies expressed as <<start-links,Link>> or <<start-depends-on,dependsOn>> are respected. This option can significantly reduce the startup time because independent containers do not need to wait for each other.
| `docker.startParallel`

|===

The `<run>` configuration element knows the following sub elements:

[[config-image-run]]
.Run configuration (<<config-image, <image> >>)
[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *capAdd*
| List of `add` elements to specify kernel parameters to add to the container.

| *capDrop*
| List of `drop` elements to specify kernel parameters to remove from the container.

| <<misc-startup, *cmd*>>
| Command which should be executed at the end of the container's startup. If not given, the image's default command is used. See <<misc-startup, Startup Arguments>> for details.

| <<container-name, *containerNamePattern*>>
| Pattern for naming the container when it is created. See <<container-name, Container Naming Strategy>> for details.

| *domainname*
| Domain name for the container

| *dns*
| List of `host` elements specifying dns servers for the container to use

| *dnsSearch*
| List of `host` elements specifying dns search domains

| *entrypoint*
| Entry point for the container. See <<misc-startup, Startup Arguments] for details.

| <<misc-env, *env*>>
| Environment variables as subelements which are set during startup of the container. They are specified in the typical maven property format as described <<misc-env,Environment and Labels>>.

| *envPropertyFile*
| Path to a property file holding environment variables. If given, the variables specified in this property file overrides the environment variables specified in the configuration.

| *extraHosts*
| List of `host` elements in the form `host:ip` to add to the container's `/etc/hosts` file. Additionally, you may specify a `host` element in the form `host:host` to have the right side host ip address resolved at container startup.

| *exposedPropertyKey*
| Set the property part for the exposed container properties as described <<start-overview,above>>. This will take precedence of the image's `alias` which is the default value. For example, when this property is set to `jboss`, then for this container its IP address is exposed in Maven property `docker.container.jboss.ip` regardless how the image is named.

| *hostname*
| Hostname of the container

| *imagePullPolicy*
| Specific pull policy for downloading the image. This overwrites any global pull policy. See the global <<image-pull-policy, imagePullPolicy>> configuration option for the possible values and the default.

| <<misc-env, *labels*>>
| Labels which should be attached to the  container. They are specified in the typical maven property format as described in <<misc-env,Environment and Labels>>.

| <<start-links, *links*>>
| Network links for connecting containers together as described in  <<start-links, Network Links>>.

| <<start-logging, *log*>>
| Log configuration for whether and how log messages from the running containers should be printed. This also can configure the https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview[log driver] to use. See <<start-logging,Logging>> for a detailed description.

| *memory*
| Memory limit in bytes

| *memorySwap*
| Total memory usage (memory + swap); use -1 to disable swap.

| *namingStrategy*
a| *This option is deprecated, please use a `containerNamePattern` instead* Naming strategy for how the container name is created:

* *none* : uses randomly assigned names from docker (default)
* *alias* : uses the `alias` specified in the `image` configuration. An error is thrown, if a container already exists with this name.

| <<network-configuration, *network*>>
| Network configuration for your container.

| <<start-port-mapping, *portPropertyFile*>>
| File path into which the mapped port properties are written. The format of this file and its purpose are also described in <<start-port-mapping,Port mapping>>

| <<start-port-mapping, *ports*>>
| <<start-port-mapping,Port mappings>> for exposing container ports to host ports.

| *privileged*
| If `true` give container full access to host

| *readOnly*
| If `true` mount the container's root filesystem as read only

| *autoRemove*
| If `true` automatically remove the container when it exits. This has no effect if <<start-restart, Restart Policy>> has been set.

| <<start-restart, *restartPolicy*>>
| Restart Policy

| *securityOpts*
| List of `<opt>` elements to specify kernel security options to add to the container. See below for an example.

| *shmSize*
| Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes.

| *skip*
| If `true` disable creating and starting of the container. This option is best used together with a Maven property which can be set from the outside.

| *tmpfs*
a| List countaintin `<mount>` elements for directories to mount with a temporary filesystem. Optionally, mount options can be appended after a ':'. See below for an example.

| *ulimits*
a| ulimits for the container. This list contains `<ulimit>` elements which three sub elements:

* `<name>` : The ulimit to set (e.g. `memlock`). Please refer to the Docker documentation for the possible values to set
* `<hard>` : The hard limit
* `<soft>` : The soft limit

See below for an example.

| *user*
| User used inside the container

| <<start-volumes, *volumes*>>
| Volume configuration for binding to host directories and from other containers. See Volumes for details.

| <<start-wait, *wait*>>
| Condition which must be fulfilled for the startup to complete. See <<start-wait,Wait>> for all possible ways to wait for a startup condition.

| *workingDir*
| Working directory for commands to run in
|===
