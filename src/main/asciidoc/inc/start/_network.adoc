The `<network>` element in the <<start-configuration, <run> >> configuration section can be used to configure the network mode of the container. This is now the preferred way for linking containers together. It knows the following sub elements:

.Network configuration
[cols="1,7"]
|===
| Element | Description

| *mode*
a| The network mode, which can be one of the following values:

* *bridge* : Bridged mode with the default Docker bridge (default)
* *host* : Share the Docker host network interfaces
* *container* : Connect to the network of the specified container. The name of the container is taken from the `<name>` element.
* *custom* : Use a custom network, which must be created before by using `docker network create`. Alternatively you can set the ```docker.autoCreateCustomNetworks``` <<global-configuration, global configuration>> parameter to ```true``` to automatically create custom networks. Custom networks are available for Docker 1.9 and newer. For more about the networking options please refer to the https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/work-with-networks[Docker documentation].

* *none* : No network will be setup.

| *name*
| For mode `container` this is the container name, which is this image alias. For Mode `custom` this is the name of the custom network.

| *alias*
| One or more alias element can be provided which gives a way for a container to be discovered by alternate names by any other container within the scope of a particular network. This configuration only has effect for when the network mode is `custom`. More than one alias can be given by providing multiple entries.
|===

If no `mode` is given but a `name`, then a `custom` network mode is assumed. For the simple modes which does not take an argument (`none`, `bridge` or `host`) a single `<net>` _mode_ `</net>` can be used as alternative to using `<network>` with a `<mode>` subelement.

.Example <network>
[source,xml]
----
<network>
   <mode>custom</mode>
   <name>my-network</name>
   <alias>box1</alias>
   <alias>box2</alias>
</network>
----

or for a simple `host` network:

.Example <net>
[source, xml]
----
<net>host</net>
----
